The project is a part of my final project for my undergraduate study
using the Algorithm from Ryan Coe (2011) for simulating Lid-driven Cavity.
From his algorithm, I re-engineered it to fit my problem, that is a box which has a fan and a baffle in it to create a flow.
The codes are mostly related to Coe's codes which has some modifications and to accomodate 3D cases, that is why I use the same name for the functions as Ryan Coe's obtained from his google scholar's website.
The codes for the Thomas' algorithm (tridiag.m) is referred to Mark Holmes, obtained from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/40722-tridiag-m?focused=3780252&tab=function.
