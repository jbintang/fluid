Building Application Package for Simulating Fluid Flow In Enclosed Space Using MATLAB
The project is a part of my final project for my undergraduate study
using the Algorithm from Ryan Coe (2011) for simulating Lid-driven Cavity.
From his algorithm, I re-engineered it to fit my problem, that is a box which has a fan and a baffle in it to create a flow.
The codes are mostly related to Coe's codes which has some modifications and to accomodate 3D cases.
