The project is a part of my final project for my undergraduate study
using the Algorithm from Ryan Coe (2011) for simulating Lid-driven Cavity.
From his algorithm, I re-engineered it to fit my problem, that is a box which has a fan and a baffle in it to create a flow.
The codes are mostly related to Coe's codes which has some modifications and to accomodate 3D cases, that is why I use the same name for the functions as Ryan Coe's obtained from his research paper:

The codes for the Thomas' algorithm (tridiag.m) is referred to Mark Holmes, obtained from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/40722-tridiag-m?focused=3780252&tab=function.
